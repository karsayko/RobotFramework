# RobotFramework

The 'Tests' folder contains my first hobby RobotFramework tests that I have created following Rahul Shetty's udemy course.
- testDemo01.robot is the very first test, it simply checks that the error message appearing after entering incorrect password on a login page is the same as expected.
- testDemo02.robot is what I am working on now, the first version has test cases checking both valid and invalid logins and checking that the card names appearing after login are as expected, using comparison of two lists.

I'm learning robot framework and github as well, so any feedback or advice is welcome in both topics.
