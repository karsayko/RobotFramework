# RobotFramework

The 'Tests' folder contains my first hobby RobotFramework tests that I have created following Rahul Shetty's udemy course.
- testDemo01.robot is the very first test, it simply checks that the error message appearing after entering incorrect password on a login page is the same as expected.
- testDemo02.robot: the first version has test cases checking both valid and invalid logins and checking that the card names appearing after login are as expected, using comparison of two lists.
- testDemo03.robot: in the first version we navigate to a child window, verify the title of it and copy an email address from a longer text to a field on the parent window.
- testDemo04.robot shows how to use parameterization to test login with multiple data sets

I'm learning robot framework and github as well, so any feedback or advice is welcome in both topics.
